# CODING TEST.

## Python code to take snapshots of AWS Oracle RDS instances. If time, I will write the other one to share the latest manual snapshot to a Disaster Recovery region in AWS.
* The script will be designed to run as a Lambda in AWS. So, this will fit nicely into my plans for the infrastructure test.
